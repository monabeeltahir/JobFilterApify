# Job Filter Application Requirements
# Most dependencies are part of Python standard library

# No external dependencies required
# The application uses only Python built-in libraries:
# - tkinter (GUI)
# - json (JSON parsing)
# - difflib (fuzzy string matching)
# - re (regular expressions)
# - os (file operations)
# - datetime (timestamps)

# Optional: For better display on some systems
# tk>=0.1.0
